1. Besides the Exception test in video, I add a RuntimeException test in addition.In PetRock.java, I use getUnHappyMessage() to create RuntimeException,and in testPetRock.java, I use testUnhappy() to test the exception.
2. I also  test assertSame. In testpetRock.java ,I use testSame() to test whether two Double object with same value are same.
3. In toString method, I delete num2 which is a private property.And test toString in testPetRock.java with testString() method.
